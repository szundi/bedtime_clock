Create an arduino program that is a countdown clock. It has 3 buttons: add a minute, add 10 minutes, and the start/stop button. They are wired in as GPIOs. Debouncing should happen in the arduino code. When powered on, the clock starts from 1 minute, not started. If the user presses the start button, it starts counting down, pressed again, it pauses. Pressed again it resumes, etc. If the start button is pressed long (2 sec), it stops the clock and resets the time to the original when just when it was first started. If the minute button is pressed, a minute is added to the remaining time either when countring down or when paused or when just waiting to be started. Same with the 10 minute button, but 10 minutes. 
There is no sound, just display.
The display is made of 8x8 = 64 WS2812 led matrix. The arduino only has one pin to drive the whole matrix, the leds are sequentially connected. It should display the remaining time like this:
- each remaining minute is a full white led
- the last fraction minute should decrease its brightness from max to 0 continuously adjistued as the seconds left decrease from the fraction minute. So basically if the time is 8 minutes 22 seconds left it'll show 8 100% bright led and one that has the brightness of 22/60.
